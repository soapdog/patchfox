## Requirements for development

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)

## Setup & Building

Patchfox uses [Mithril](https://mithril.js.org), [Electron](https://electronjs.org) and requires [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) for development. After you have NodeJS installed, you can install the dependencies with:

```
$ npm install
```

And run a development version of the app using:

```
$ npm run start
```

To build use:

```
$ npm run build
```


## Setup inside Patchfox

Patchfox will use your default SSB data folder if available (the `.ssb` folder inside your home folder). If this is your first time using SSB, Patchfox will create that folder for you and place new keys inside.
