## Setup & Building

Patchfox requires [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) for development. After you have NodeJS installed, you can install the dependencies with:

```
$ npm install
```

And run the backend use:

```
$ npm run start
```

To run the minimal UI use:

```
$ npm run ui
```


## Setup inside Patchfox

Patchfox will use your default SSB data folder if available (the `.ssb` folder inside your home folder). If this is your first time using SSB, Patchfox will create that folder for you and place new keys inside.
