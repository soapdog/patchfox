# contact
Contact messages are used to follow or unfollow another user. This affects your social graph and gossiping. Once you follow a given user, you'll start replicating all of that user's feed and, depending on how your client is configured, their friends. Most clients will do two levels of replication, so you end up with all your friends' data and friends-of-friends' data, much like the physical world in which you receive gossip regarding your friends' friends.
