This message is akin to _likes_, _hearts_ and _stars_ in social networks. They represent an intention to support the message. Secure Scuttlebutt doesn't mandate a term to be used in this case and some clients will call it _like_ while others call it _dig_, it doesn't matter, the message structure is the same.
