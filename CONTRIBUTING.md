# Contributing to Patchfox

First and foremost, thanks a lot for the interest in contributing to this little project. We really appreciate that.

Your first stop is the [development documentation](https://patchfox.org/development). It will explain how the source-code is organised, and how _packages_ — the fundamental module unit of Patchfox — work.

The [issue tracker](https://github.com/soapdog/patchfox/issues) lists all fixes and enhancements that are currently on track. Feel free to browse them and reach out if you'd like to help with any specific issue. Also, don't be discouraged from playing with the code and working on something that is not on the issue list.
