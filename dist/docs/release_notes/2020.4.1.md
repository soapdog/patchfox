# Release 2020.4.1

## Refactor for AMO

AMO reviewers disabled the add-on and requested changes. I'm working on the needed changes.

## Refactor

* Changed _vote expression_ to be ðŸ’– instead of "Like" which felt boring.

## Bugs

* fixed a bug where _control+click_ on the round avatar in a message card would go to the wrong package (a typo).
