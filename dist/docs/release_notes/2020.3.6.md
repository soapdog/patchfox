# Release 2020.3.6

* **Background:**
  * Contextual menu changed to support multiline quotation. Cherry picked a nice fix by Christian Bundy.
* **Core:**
  * MessageDropdown component: fixed the _Open In New Tab_ item.
* **Docs:**
  * Bug fix in the blog documentation by johanbove.
* **Profile:**
  * Added a button to create a new post mentioning that user.
* **Blog:**
  * Converted the blog package into a miniapp so that I can add featured that help bloggers our without cluttering the rest of the UI. The first feature added is a _RSS/Atom importer_. You can use this to list the blog posts from a blog and then select a specific post content to be used by the _blog compose view_ to post a new blog post to SSB. You still need to clean up the post and replace any image link with a blob image from SSB, that is not automatic yet.
