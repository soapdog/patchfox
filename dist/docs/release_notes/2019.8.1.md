# Release 2019.8.1

This release took a long time to build. From the technical side, the most important and time consuming change has been the transition from [Rollup](https://rollupjs.com) to [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org). The reasoning behind this change was because it is impossible to use _rollup_ with _CommonJS_ code that is not _strict mode_ safe. I lost more than a month trying to work this out and still couldn't.
