# Release 2019.11.2


## Changes

* Changed the `zip.bat` script that generates the XPI so that builds are reproducible.
* Split the bundle into a platform bundle for SSB routines and the rest of the app. This was done because [AMO](https://addons.mozilla.org) restricts how large a bundle can get. It will reject add-ons with bundles larger than 4mb. Currently our two bundles sit at 3.2mb each which is too close to the limit for my taste but it is what I can do now.

## Fixes

* [[ settings ]] the `remote` automatic filling was including `@` in the URL when it shouldn't.
