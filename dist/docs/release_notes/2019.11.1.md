# Release 2019.11.1

## Changes

So many changes happened that it is even difficult to list. The whole system was refactored and reorganized into a new structure that is easier to experiment with.

I removed some features from this release as their integration in the new structure is not yet completed and I didn't want to present visual elements for items that were not working.

I will write more about it later.
