## Fixes

_I apologise for the amount of deep development topics in this changelog. I try to describe the changes in terms of their high-level impact and usability, but during the making of this version there were so many silly gotchas, that to document everything I had to resort to tech speak._

- **npm scripts:** The `copy:docs` script was wrong and was not copying root files. Patched many of those scripts.
- **Spectre.css:** Browserify was borking the import from `node_modules/`, so I made an extra `copy:spectre-icons-css` script that copies it to the _default theme_ directory, and patched the SCSS code to import from there.
- **NPM flamefest while updating:** ðŸ˜¤ A gazillion errors happened when trying to bring dependencies up to date...
- **Zine:** The old masonry grid was buggy. Unfortunately Firefox is yet to support `grid-template-rows: masonry;`. So I'm using a fallback to CSS Grid, and left the masonry grid template in place. I expect support for that CSS will arrive shortly since it is already possible to use it in Firefox if you switch some internal flags in `about:config`.
- **CSP:** Had to change the CSP for the add-on to support `unsafe-eval` because `ssb-gatherings` uses `Function()`. Mozilla will probably complain and reject the add-on because of that. I might need to revert this and remove some of the gathering features.
- **Show unknown renamed to show extras in display settings:** At the beginning Patchfox had a core set of messages that it understood. As the packaging system expanded, this set became a dynamic set based on which packages are loaded. To be able to view these potential extra messages on thread viewers, you need to enable **Show Extra** in the _Display Settings_. The default option has been changed to display these extra messages.
