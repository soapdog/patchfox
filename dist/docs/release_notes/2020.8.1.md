## Fixes:

* **Core Components:**
    * LAYOUT: hovering an `AvatarTile` now shows a pointer cursor.
    * MAYBE FEATURE: changed the `VoteCounter` to require a click before fetching votes. The amount of `ssb-ws` calls flying around in a message list was too damn high.  
* **Hub:**
    * LAYOUT: changed the size of message id display on top of thread.
    * LAYOUT: optimized the text on the top of channel display options.
    * FEATURE: the channel view has a new option to show only root messages.
