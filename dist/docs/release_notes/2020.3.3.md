# Release 2020.3.3

* **MessageDropdown:** fixing layout for the dropdown menu.
* **README:** fixed build instructions.
* **Custom URLs:** Custom URLs are back but they changed format. The new routines are using [ssb-custom-uri](https://git.sr.ht/~soapdog/ssb-custom-uri).
  * I've also added `ext+patchfox:` as a custom protocol schema. This way, other apps and extensions can launch Patchfox if they want.
* **VoteCounter:** new component to count votes on a message âœ¨.
* **Post:** 
  * Added `@mentions` to compose window.
  * Added `<VoteCounter>` component to card.
* **Blog:** Added `@mentions` to compose window.
* **Contacts:**
  * Added hyperlink with custom URL to feed id display.
* **SSB:** 
  * Changing all threads to filter private msgs out. It was cute to see them among the other messages with the orange private border but I'm beginning to think this may lead to problems in the future. I'm filtering them out with a pipeline entry to `threads`.
  * Changed keyword to search SSB from omnibox to `ssb?`.
  * Added an overly complicated and confusing `workQueue` to enable self-contained components to schedule their queries and be notified when they are ready. This queue works alongside an ephemeral cache (just for the queue results). This leads to a more responsive Patchfox but the code is stupid and err on the side of excess loops of the `processQueue` function, but it is working...
