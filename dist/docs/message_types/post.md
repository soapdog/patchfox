Post messages are text-based messages intended for a public or private audience. They are what you normally see on feeds from social networks and make most of the meaningful interaction in Scuttlebutt at the moment.

> **Attention:** Patchfox currently doesn't support private messages.

These messages have a lot of fields. Lets go through the most important ones:

* `text`: This is a Markdown-based textual content that is the body of your message. The other users will see a rendered version of this content.
* `root`: In case this message is part of a thread of messages. The `root` fields points at the topmost message.
* `branch`: If this message is a reply to another message, then `branch` points at the message this message is replying to.
* `channel`: The channel this message is being posted to. It works much like hashtags but don't need to be present in the content itself.

There are other fields such as `recps`- which holds the recipients for the messages and is used by private messages- and `mentions`- which is used to help link mentioned users and messages.
