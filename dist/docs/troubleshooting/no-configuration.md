# No Configuration

To use Patchfox, you need to configure it with your Secure Scuttlebutt secret and remote. The easiest way to do it is by <a href="#" id="options-trigger">going to the Add-on options page for Patchfox</a>, there you can use the button labeled <i>Select Secret</i> to browse for your `.ssb/secret` file. Your remote and keys will be acquired from that file.

The <i>.ssb</i> folder is a hidden folder and your system might not display it to you by default.
