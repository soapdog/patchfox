# Patchfox :id=readme
This is a new client for [Secure Scuttlebutt](http://scuttlebutt.nz) packaged as a Web Extension. This is a new client for [Secure Scuttlebutt](http://scuttlebutt.nz) packaged as a Web Extension for Firefox. It is available on:

* [Firefox Add-ons Portal](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/patchfox/)
* [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/patchfox/ocanekmedfooidiahhelofknmpobdmdp?hl=en-GB&authuser=0)

So if you just want to run it, that's the easiest way. Read on if you want to develop with it. Read on if you want to develop with it.

## Requirements

* [Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/) or [Firefox Nightly](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/nightly/) (needed so that you can sideload unsigned add-ons)
* [Scuttle Shell](https://github.com/ssbc/scuttle-shell). This is a soft requirement. You can use your own _sbot_ or even have another client such as [Patchwork](http://github.com/ssbc/patchwork) or [Patchbay](http://github.com/ssbc/patchbay) running and providing a running _sbot_. 


## Setup & Building

Patchfox uses [Svelte](https://svelte.technology) and requires [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) for development. After you have NodeJS installed, you can install the dependencies with:

```
$ npm install
```

And build the add-on with:

```
$ npm run clean-build
```

If you want to develop with a watcher that rebuilds the add-on when file changes use:

```
$ npm run clean-dev
```

## Running

Go to [about:debugging](about:debugging) on Firefox, select `this firefox` and click to add a temporary add-on. Select the `manifest.json` file from the `dist/` folder from this repository.

## Setup inside Patchfox

Once patchfox is running, it needs to learn your _remote_ and _secret_, you can just click the "browse" button on the setup screen and select your `.ssb/secret` file. Patchfox will use the data inside your secret file to derive your remote address. Remember to click save. 

After saving Patchfox will then try loading your public feed. You need to have a running _sbot_ for it to work.
